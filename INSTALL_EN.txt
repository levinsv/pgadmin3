Dependencies
-------------
cmake 3.2
gcc10-c++

wxWidgets 3.2, build from source (https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/):
     tar -xf wxWidgets-3.2.2.1.tar.bz2
     cd wxWidgets-3.2.2.1
     ./configure --with-gtk --enable-unicode
     make

PostgreSQL 15.1
libxml2
libxslt

Compile under Linux
-------
mkdir build
cd build
CXXFLAGS="-DNO_WXJSON_GIT" cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target all -j 3 --

The resulting pgAdmin3 executable should be placed in the directory of the original pgadmin3

There may be problems with the missing kwlist.h file
It can be taken from the Postgresql 15 sources and put in include/parser/

There may be problems compiling the JSON parser.
It can be eliminated (as well as the experimental part with Git) by defining NO_WXJSON_GIT as done above through CXXFLAGS.
